# Probe

Probe allows you to interact with your data with natural language.
You can ask questions about your data an get natural answers.

```python
import polars as pl

import probe

data = pl.scan_csv("../data/sales_data.csv")
output = probe.ask(data, "Who are the best sales rep")

```
It will print something like this:

```
Here are the top 5 sales representatives ranked by their total sales:
    1. Karen Le leads with $255,723.09 in sales
    2. Emma Kumar with $181,779.21
    3. James Roy with $147,749.73
    4. Omar Cohen with $145,889.03
    5. Ming Nielsen with $142,345.37
Karen Le significantly outperforms her colleagues, generating nearly $74,000 more in sales than the second-best performer, Emma
Kumar.
```
The answer is stored as a string in the output:

```python
output.answer
```
You can always access the raw python code here:
